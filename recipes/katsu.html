    <h2><strong>How to make Katsu</strong></h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken Breasts:</strong> Cut one breast in half to make two cutlets</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> All you need is salt and pepper (maybe miso if you really want it)</li>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor and promotes browning.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg adds moisture and gives the panko something to stick to.</li>
            <li><strong>Panko:</strong> This creates the crunchy breading of the katsu</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong> High smoke point oil will do the best for this. This is how you fry the chicken</li>
        </ul>
